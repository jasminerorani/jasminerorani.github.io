Jake Knapp of [the Sprint book](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas-ebook/dp/B010MH1DAQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1517870511&sr=1-1) fame is working on a new book. (You can get a sneak peak at it [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Distraction-Energy-Matters-ebook/dp/B078QSCM3V).)

I like how Jake has now written two books that focus on problems he first noticed in his own life. His first book has been pretty successful and has allowed him to teach the contents of the book in the form of workshops around Europe and the US. And I'm sure if he wanted to he could charge a premium to coach a specific project team through a real project (vs. a workshop simulation). Jake's ideas for his two books started off as [blog posts](https://medium.com/@jakek).

So Jake's formula is:

1. See a problem
2. Come up with and codify a solution
3. Blog about it
4. Write a book (or make a toolkit or something else you can sell)
5. Run workshops (like a book tour that you get paid for)
6. Coach / consult

âœ…

This formula is obviously not unique to Jake. The point is: it's a good one.
