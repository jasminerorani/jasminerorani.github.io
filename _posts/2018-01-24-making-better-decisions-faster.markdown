I listened to [The Product Breakfast Club podcast](https://www.productbreakfastclub.com) episode 8: How to make better decisions, faster. It's made by Jonathan from [AJ & Smart](https://ajsmart.com) and [Jake Knapp](https://jakeknapp.com), author of the 'Sprint' book.

Lesson learned: When you're having meetings and making decisions as a team, then you need to use an agreed process for making decisions.

To me it's like trying to drive from A to B and everyone in the car wants to pull the steering wheel in different directions so they can take their preferred route to get to B. The result is you don't make progress and/or waste time.

As Jonathan and Jake highlight on the pod, an effective, shared decision making process can look something like a design sprint. You can read more about this process in [Jake's book](https://www.thesprintbook.com).

How does your team make decisions? Is everyone following the same process? Have you tried the design sprint or another design thinking-style exercise?
