Nintendo's new Labo product reminds me of the DIY science kits that were popular when I was young. You could make your own radio or a door bell using a little toolkit that came with instructions and everything you needed.

Labo is similar except it's for making your own toys. And those toys integrate with Nintendo Switch's controllers, screens so you can interact with them in some cool ways. For example, you can build a fishing rod, connect it to a Switch controller, and then catch fish on your Switch screen.
